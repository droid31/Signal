### What is signal?
Signal is an open-source app, designed to be secure yet provide a seamless messaging experience.
Many of you might be using whatsapp, but today I am going to present my case on why signal is a better alternative.

# SECURITY and PRIVACY
Signal is by far the **best** when it comes to protecting user privacy. It is better than Whatsapp by a long shot. Signal uses the **open-source** Signal Protcol to implement the end-to-end encryption in its messages.
<br>
### Industry leading encryption standard
Signal encrypts your messages, calls, and even the metadata. Signal is the only messaging app that encrypts even the metadata to protect the user from all fronts.<br>

> Metadata refers to the data about the data. For example if you share an image, it contains the EXIF information about the device model, camera resolution, time, location, etc.

Signal uses state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption *(powered by the **open source Signal Protocol**)* which is touted as the gold standard of encryption by many cybersecurity professionals. Even Signal can't read your messages as the chats are end-to-end encrypted.<br>

> End-to-End chats are encrypted from the sender's device and decrypted at the reciever's device using a secure cryptographic key. And since the messages are stored on the local storage instead of the server, only you are in control.

To prevent physical access to the messages, the messages are stored on the storage in encrypted format. Therefore if your mobile is stolen or the storage is compromised, the chats are irretrieveable. Moreover, the app supports biometric authentication/screen lock to prevent unauthorised access.

### Stored data
Signal stores as minimal data as possible. If ever the signal servers are hacked, they will only contain the *account creation date* and *last connection date*. See how even FBI lost it to the privacy of Signal messenger [here](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/signal-subpoena-privacy-gag-order/).

> "The only Signal user data we have, and the only data the US government obtained as a result, was the date of last use -- **NOT** user messages, groups, contacts, profile information, or anything else." -Signal.org

### Contacts
Signal doesn't directly sends any of your contact list to the server. Instead, it uses a *cryptographic hash function* to obfuscate phone numbers before sending them to the server.

### Verify calls
As with text messages, Signal includes a clever method for confirming the person you're calling is who they say they are and not intercepting your call. Both callers see the same randomly generated two-word phrase.<br>
If you think you might be speaking to an imposter, simply demand the other caller say the security phrase.

### Sealed sender
In addition to the end-to-end encryption that protects every Signal message, The Signal service is designed to minimise the data that is retained about signal users. By design it **does not** store a record of your contacts, social graph, conversation list, profile name, avatar, group memberships, group titles, etc.

### Open Source
Being open source is another perk of Signal messenger, as the whole code is published on github, anyone can verify the code, suggest improvements, report security errors. In Contrast, whatsapp is closed source, so any vulnerability has a high chance of being expoloited.

# Features
Ok, now you have an idea about the security of signal messenger. Let's talk features.

### Whatsapp features
Signal has all features that Whatsapp has to provide (excluding status). Every feature works seamlessly within the app. Moreover, there are many unique features that Whatsapp hasn't added yet. So, take a look at some unique features.

### Note to Self
Ever wanted to jot down something quickly? Why not use Signal for that too. Compose a message and select "Note to Self" in the contact list. Don't worry this is end-to-end encrypted too. You can even write your passwords here (although i would recommend a password manager for that).

### View-once media
Want to send your photo, but don't want it to be stored on the reciever's device? Don't worry, Signal has you covered. Just select to send a view-once message and it will be deleted as soon as the reciever views the media. *kaboom!*

### Un-compressed media
Fed up as Whatsapp compressed the images, and the reciever got a fuzzy image? Not here, signal transfers the media files *as-it-is* and doesn't perform any compression algorithm. So, images will be as clear as they are in your phone.

### Built-in image editor
Want to blur some part of an image before sharing? No need for a separate app. Signal has the option in the app itself. You can also blur faces you don't want to reveal.

### SMS manager
Signal can also be used in place of the traditional SMS app, this allows you to encrypt the SMS on the device too.

### Incognito keyboard
While using the app, the keyboard won't record your typing styles and word personalisation. However I would recommend using a secure keyboard app altogether.

### Local chat backups
You can backup chats locally, but the chats are encrypted using the pin you set during registration. This backup can even be uploaded to the cloud or migrated to the SD card.

### React to messages
You can react to the messages, same as you can react to comments on facebook.

### Use multiple instances
Signal supports all major platforms (Android, iOS, MacOS, Linux, Windows). Each signal app runs it's own independant instance with android app being the master. <br>
Essentially this means that, you can use signal from your desktop too. But the phone doesn't need to be online for you to use signal. But in case of whatsapp the phone need to be online for the client to work.

#### This marks the end of all the security practices and unique features, but there is more to come with every update. Before moving on to the FAQ, let's hear it from the pros.
 
> ### "I use Signal every day."<br>
  > **Edward Snowden**<br>
  *Whistleblower and privacy advocate*
  
  

> ### "I trust Signal because it’s well built, but more importantly, because of how it’s built: open source, peer reviewed, and funded entirely by grants and donations. A refreshing model for how critical services should be built."<br>
  > **Jack Dorsey**<br>
  *CEO of Twitter and Square*



> ### "I am regularly impressed with the thought and care put into both the security and the usability of this app. It's my first choice for an encrypted conversation."<br>

# FAQ

### Why should I ditch whatsapp?
Whatsapp isn't half as secure as Signal, it has many security threats. In the race to provide a convenient experience, whatsapp has traded off privacy with a great margin.<br><br>
The chats are not encrypted while in the storage, also, it is kept in google drive/icloud in plain text format without any encryption.

### Anything else?
Yes, what about the fact that whatsapp has already been compromised by an Israeli firm, which installed spyware on top of whatsapp and intercepted all the chats. This spyware was found in about 1400 high profile government officials using Whatapp. The israeli firm was able to bypass the end-to-end encryption and read all messages. Read more about it [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/whatsapp-israeli-firm-deeply-involved-in-hacking-our-users).

#### But isn't whatsapp encrypted?
Apparently whatsapp uses the same encryption protocol for sending/receiving messages as Signal, but it has modified the open source code and installed a **back door** in it. This backdoor helps whatsapp to easily bypass the end-to-end encryption and get access to all your chats and information. Read more about the exploit [here](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-design-feature-encrypted-messages).

#### I am still inclined towards whatsapp, is there anything else?
Well, you seem like a tough nut to crack.<br><br>
Before explaining further i want to ask you something.<br>
### *How much can you trust Facebook?*
This is perhaps the most compelling reason to use Signal. As whatsapp is owned by Facebook, and Facebook is known for it's long-standing lack of respect for user's privacy.<br>
Facebook isn't secure when it comes to data collection and handling, from the *Cambridge Analytica affair* to it's practice for sharing data about users with phone manufacturers.<br><br>
In 2017, European regulators took action against Facebook for *sharing Whatsapp's users' phone numbers with its Facebook social network for advertising purposes.* Firmly in breach of data protection regulations. Facebook had previously claimed it would never implement such system.
<br>
### So, Facebook doesn't care about privacy, prove it!
Facebook's lack of concern for users' privacy is the reason why **Whatsapp co-developer *Brian Acton* left Facebook in 2017 and co-founded Signal Foundation with Marlinspike later**. Brian has harshly criticised Facebook's approach to privacy and *revealed that Facebook coached him "to explain that it would be really difficult to merge the data of Facebook and Whatsapp together"* when giving statement to European Union regulators in 2014.<br><br>
Facebook's desire to insert adverts and commercial messaging into Whatsapp and potentially compromising it's security prompted Acton to leave Facebook, and sacrificing about $850 million in stocks in process. Acton's fellow developer also walked out on Facebook following reported disputes with the company over its efforts to weaken encryption.

Facebook is also thinking of merging whatsapp with Facebook keeping in mind the large volume of whatsapp users that aren't on facebook.

### Ok, I'll do it, but what about my friends?
Well tell them to switch too, it doesn't cost anything. You just have to download a free app. Signal features provide above and beyond whatsapp. Also, someone has take initiative and start the change, tell your friends to incorporate it slowly and build and ecosystem in which you are using whatsapp less. Don't push it, slowly try to shift towards signal and don't uninstall Whatsapp on day 1.

### But I need whatsapp for professional messaging.
Ok, then how about keeping both the apps, and using signal wherever possible. Even if you are not using signal's encrypted messaging services, it can work as an SMS app hence it will serve a purpose no matter what. We need to work together to break this monopoly of tech giants. We need to support OPEN-SOURCE software which is free of cost and protects your privacy and installing signal could be a great start. Kindly consider.
